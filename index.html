       <h2> Structural Design Programs </h2>
         <h3> ETABS </h3>

               <p id="2nd">
                    ETABS is an engineering software product that caters to multi-story building analysis and design. Modeling tools and templates, code-based load prescriptions, analysis methods and solution techniques, all coordinate with the grid-like geometry unique to this class of structure. Basic or advanced systems under static or dynamic conditions may be evaluated using ETABS. For a sophisticated assessment of seismic performance, modal and direct-integration time-history analyses may couple with P-Delta and Large Displacement effects. Nonlinear links and concentrated PMM or fiber hinges may capture material nonlinearity under monotonic or hysteretic behavior. Intuitive and integrated features make applications of any complexity practical to implement. Interoperability with a series of design and documentation platforms makes ETABS a coordinated and productive tool for designs which range from simple 2D frames to elaborate modern high-rises.

          <h3> SAFE</h3>

                <P id="3rd">
                    From framing layout to detail drawing production, SAFE integrates every aspect of the engineering design process in one easy and intuitive environment. SAFE provides unmatched productivity to the engineer with its truly unique combination of power, comprehensive capabilities, and ease-of-use.   
                </P>

          <h3> REVIT</h3>

               <P id="4th">
                     In primitive times, AutoCAD is the fundamental core program needed by the engineers, architects and construction professionals for functional expertise on projects. But with the emergence of Autodesk Revit software, it can make work for professionals easier and create a better environment for each discipline.

                    Revit is an architectural design and documentation software program used by architects and engineers for managing building design and detailing the model.
